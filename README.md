# AI usage
I used ChatGPT and Gemini AI to explain the pseudo code from the book and how to implement it in QT CPP and I asked how the algorithm works. And I ask some question like:
- I asked if the formula was correct according to the book.
- Basic QtCreator.
- Connect a button to specific function.
- The different Convex Hull n Slow Convex.
- Fixing some errors.
- Create a visualization to see the output results.

# Collaboration usage
In this assignment, I collaborated with Adhit, Ryan, Azzam, n Deric to complete the task. I was confused while debugging Qt. I didn't know how to implement the convex hull and slow convex formulas in Qt, so I asked them about how the algorithms work, the syntax, and the differences between the two. I completed this task by learning from my friends' understanding.
